# B.1: Baseline and channel management

Rule groups: **B0** (milestone 0 baseline and API conventions) and **B1** (channel management).
Check: `python3 /spec/channels/checks/check_channels_1.py` (append `B0` or `B1` to run one group).
The rule numbers below match its output.

Builds on Component A: register/login, workspaces, `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/channels` and
`POST /api/channels/{id}/join`. The B checks use those routes to set up their data, so a broken A
route shows up here as `setup: ...`.

## Uses

Call these from Component A. Do not write a second version of any of them.

| Function | Used here for |
|---|---|
| `require_user(request)`, `json_error(...)`, `tx()`, `user_to_json(row)` | Auth, errors, transactions, member lists |
| `get_workspace(slug)`, `member_role(workspace_id, user_id)` | Access and owner checks |
| `create_channel_row(...)`, `channel_to_json(row)`, `get_channel(id)` | Creating and returning channels |
| `add_channel_member(c, ...)`, `add_workspace_member(c, ...)`, `join_channel(...)` | Joins; B1.9 relies on `add_workspace_member` joining `#general` |

## Adds

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `can_read_channel(user_id, channel)` | The access rule below |
| `require_writable(channel)` | `423` when the channel is archived |
| `validate_topic(topic)` | String of at most 250 characters, else `400` |
| `remove_channel_member(c, channel_id, user_id)` | Deletes if present; returns True only when a row was removed |
| `set_archived(actor, channel_id, flag)` | Rule B1.10 |
| `workspace_detail(user, slug, include_archived)` | Rules B1.4, B1.5 (B5.7 fills `read_state`) |
| `emit_event(c, channel_id, kind, payload)` | Architecture rule 3. Add it now and call it from `add_channel_member` (`member.joined`), `remove_channel_member` (`member.left`), the topic PATCH (`channel.updated`) and `set_archived` (`channel.archived` / `channel.unarchived`) whenever they change something. B.4 makes these events visible. |

**Access rule (all of Component B).** A user can read and write a channel if they are a member of
it, or if the channel is public and they are a workspace member whose role is not `guest`. Private
channels are for their members only.

## Rules

### B0. Baseline and conventions

B0.1 **Health.** `GET /api/health` on port `8000` returns `200` and `{"status": "ok", "node_id": 0}`.

B0.2 **Node ids.** `GET /api/health` on ports `8000`, `8001`, `8002` returns `node_id` `0`, `1`,
`2` respectively.

B0.3 **WebSocket rejects a bad token.** A WebSocket handshake to `/api/ws?token=<made-up token>`
gets `401` and is never upgraded (no `101`).

B0.4 **Redis runs.** `127.0.0.1:6379` answers `PING` with `+PONG`; `start.sh` restarts it if it dies.

B0.5 **Boot files.** `/app/start.sh` exists and is executable; `/app/requirements.txt` exists.

B0.6 **Crash tolerance.** After `SIGKILL` of the process listening on `8001`, ports `8000` and
`8002` keep answering `GET /api/health` with `200`, and `8001` answers again within 15 seconds.
The check runs this rule last.

B0.7 **401 comes first.** Each of these returns `401` with no `Authorization` header, and with a
made-up token, before anything checks whether the id or slug exists:
`GET /api/workspaces/{slug}`, `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/channels`, `PATCH /api/channels/{id}`,
`POST /api/channels/{id}/leave`, `GET /api/channels/{id}/members`,
`POST /api/channels/{id}/archive`, `GET` and `POST /api/channels/{id}/messages`,
`GET /api/messages/{id}/replies`, `GET /api/search`, `GET /api/channels/{id}/pins`,
`POST /api/messages/{id}/pin`, `GET` and `POST /api/channels/{id}/read`.

B0.8 **404 for unknown ids.** With a valid token, an unknown channel id returns `404` on
`GET`/`POST /api/channels/{id}/messages`, `GET /api/channels/{id}/members`,
`PATCH /api/channels/{id}` and `GET /api/channels/{id}/read`; an unknown message id returns `404`
on `GET /api/messages/{id}/replies` and `POST /api/messages/{id}/pin`.

### B1. Channel management

B1.1 **ChannelObj.** `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/channels` with `{name, is_private?, topic?}`
returns `201` and `{channel}` where `channel` has every field `id`, `workspace_id`, `name`,
`is_private`, `is_dm` (always `false` here), `topic`, `is_archived` (`false`). `topic` defaults to
`""`. Any other body field, such as `description`, is ignored and never fills `topic`.

B1.2 **Topic length.** `topic` is a string of at most 250 characters. 250 is accepted; 251 returns
`400`, both on create and on `PATCH /api/channels/{id}`.

B1.3 **Name rules.** `name` must match `^[a-z0-9-]{1,32}$`: `"bad name"`, `"UPPER"`, a
33-character name and `""` each return `400`. A name already used in the same workspace returns
`409` (another workspace may reuse it).

B1.4 **Workspace detail.** `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}` returns `200` and
`{workspace, channels, read_state}`. `channels` lists every non-archived channel of the workspace
as `ChannelObj`, except private channels the caller is not a member of. A caller who is not a
workspace member gets `403`; an unknown slug gets `404`. (`read_state` is defined in B5.7.)

B1.5 **Archived channels.** Archived channels are left out of `channels` unless the query has
`include_archived=1` or `include_archived=true`.

B1.6 **Topic updates.** `PATCH /api/channels/{id}` with `{topic}` returns `200` and `{channel}`
with the new topic when the caller is a member of the channel or the workspace owner. Anyone else
gets `403`. It emits `channel.updated`.

B1.7 **Channel members.** `GET /api/channels/{id}/members` returns `200` and
`{members: [UserObj, ...]}` for every member of the channel. The caller must pass the access rule
(else `403`).

B1.8 **Leave.** `POST /api/channels/{id}/leave` returns `200` and `{channel}`, and the caller is no
longer listed in the channel's members. Leaving a channel you are not in also returns `200` and
changes nothing. It emits `member.left` only when a member was removed.

B1.9 **New workspace members join #general.** Whenever a user becomes a workspace member (creating
the workspace, open join of any public channel, or accepting an invitation) they are also added to
`#general`.

B1.10 **Archive.** `POST /api/channels/{id}/archive` and `POST /api/channels/{id}/unarchive` are for
the workspace owner only (anyone else, admins included, gets `403`). Each returns `200` and
`{channel}` with `is_archived` `true` or `false`; archiving an archived channel (or unarchiving an
active one) returns `200` and emits nothing. While a channel is archived, posting a message or
reply, editing a message, adding or removing a reaction, and `PATCH /api/channels/{id}` each return
`423`. Unarchiving restores write access.

Every request must answer within 5 seconds.
