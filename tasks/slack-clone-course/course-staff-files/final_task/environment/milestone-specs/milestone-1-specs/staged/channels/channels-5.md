# B.5: Mentions and read state

Rule group: **B5**.
Check: `python3 /spec/channels/checks/check_channels_5.py`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Do not start this step until `check_channels_4.py` prints `RESULT: 9 passed, 0 failed`. The B5
check learns `event_id`s through the WebSocket, so B.4 must work first.

## Uses

Call these from earlier steps. Do not write a second version of any of them.

| Function | Used here for |
|---|---|
| `create_message(...)`, `edit_message(...)` | Call `resolve_mentions` in both and store the result on the message row (B5.9) |
| `message_to_json(row)` | Return the stored `mentions` |
| `workspace_detail(...)` | Fill `read_state` (B5.7) |
| `get_channel(id)`, `can_read_channel(user_id, channel)`, `tx()` | `404`, `403`, transactions |

## Adds

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `resolve_mentions(c, body, channel, author_id)` | B5.1 to B5.3, B5.9; returns a list of user ids |
| `read_state(user_id, channel_id)` | B5.4, B5.6 |
| `mark_read(user, channel_id, body)` | B5.5, B5.8 |

## Rules

### B5. Mentions and read state

B5.1 **Resolve @username.** Find mentions with the regex `(?<![\w@.])@(\w+)`. A name that is the
username of a member of the channel's workspace adds that user's id to `mentions`. Punctuation
around the mention is fine: `(@bob),` mentions bob.

B5.2 **What does not count.** `mentions` is deduplicated (first appearance order) and never holds
the author. Email-shaped text (`bob@example.com`), in-word `@` (`hey@bob`), users who are not in
the channel's workspace, and unknown names add nothing.

B5.3 **@channel.** `@channel` adds every member of the channel except the author, merged and
deduplicated with explicit mentions.

B5.4 **Read state.** `GET /api/channels/{id}/read` returns `200` and
`{read_state: {channel_id, last_read_event_id, unread_count, mention_count}}`. `last_read_event_id`
starts at `0`. `unread_count` counts non-deleted messages (top-level and replies) in the channel
that the caller did not write and whose `event_id` is greater than `last_read_event_id`.
`mention_count` counts those of them whose `mentions` contain the caller.

B5.5 **Mark read.** `POST /api/channels/{id}/read` with `{last_read_event_id}` stores the larger of
the old and new values (the cursor never moves back) and returns `200` and the recomputed
`{read_state}`.

B5.6 **Own messages never count.** The reader's own messages, including ones that mention
themself, never add to their `unread_count` or `mention_count`.

B5.7 **Read state in workspace detail.** In `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}`, `read_state` is a list
holding one read-state object (same shape and values as B5.4) for each channel in `channels`.

B5.8 **Validation and access.** A `last_read_event_id` that is not a non-negative integer (for
example `"abc"`) returns `400`. A caller who fails the access rule gets `403` on `GET` and `POST`;
an unknown channel id returns `404`.

B5.9 **Edits recompute mentions.** `PATCH /api/messages/{id}` resolves mentions again from the new
body and stores them: adding `@bob` puts bob's id in `mentions` and adds 1 to bob's
`mention_count` (while the message is unread); removing it empties `mentions` and the count drops
back.

B5.10 **Bad input is a 400, never a 500.** Every Spec B route checks the JSON type of each field it
reads before using it. A wrong type (for example a number for `topic`, `name` or `body`, `null` for
`topic` or `body`, a string `parent_id`, a number for `emoji`, `null` or `true` for
`last_read_event_id`) returns `400`, and so does a body that is not valid JSON. No route answers
`500` to bad input.
