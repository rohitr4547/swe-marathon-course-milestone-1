# B.4: WebSocket events and ordering

Rule group: **B4**.
Check: `python3 /spec/channels/checks/check_channels_4.py`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Do not start this step until `check_channels_3.py` prints `RESULT: 7 passed, 0 failed`.

## Uses

Call these from earlier steps. Do not write a second version of any of them.

| Function | Used here for |
|---|---|
| `emit_event(c, channel_id, kind, payload)` | Every write in the B4.4 table must already call it, inside its own transaction |
| `user_for_token(token)` | The `?token=` on the WebSocket URL |
| `get_channel(id)`, `can_read_channel(user_id, channel)` | Who may subscribe |
| `server.py: ws_handler(request)` | Keep the `401` from A0.3; add everything below to it |

## Adds

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `head_event_id(channel_id)` | The channel's `last_event_id` (`0` when it has none) |
| `events_after(channel_id, since)` | Event rows with `event_id > since`, in order |
| `ws_handler` subscribe, resume and live loop | Architecture rule 4: one background task per connection polls `events` every 0.05 s |

## Rules

### B4. WebSocket events

B4.1 **Subscribe.** `ws://127.0.0.1:800N/api/ws?token=<token>` upgrades (`101`) on every node.
After the client sends `{"type": "subscribe", "channel_id": <id>}`, the server immediately replies
`{"type": "subscribed", "channel_id": <id>, "head_event_id": <int>}`, where `head_event_id` is the
channel's newest `event_id` (`0` if none) and is the same on every node. A caller who fails the
access rule gets `{"type": "error", ...}` and no subscription. Subscribing again to the same
channel only sends another `subscribed` frame; it must not duplicate later frames.

B4.2 **Live delivery across nodes.** After `subscribed`, every durable event of that channel,
committed on any node, arrives within 1 second as one JSON frame
`{"type": <kind>, "event_id": <int>, "channel_id": <id>, ...payload}`. For a post on `8001`,
subscribers on `8000` and `8002` receive `message.created` with `event_id` = head + 1 and
`message.id` equal to the new message.

B4.3 **Dense ordering.** Every committed durable event advances its channel's `event_id` by exactly
1: no gaps, no duplicates, frames in `event_id` order, and the same sequence on all three nodes
even when consecutive writes go to different nodes.

B4.4 **Event kinds.** Each of these writes commits exactly one event, in the same transaction:

| Write | `type` | Payload keys |
|---|---|---|
| post without `parent_id` | `message.created` | `message` (MessageObj) |
| post with `parent_id` | `message.reply` | `message` |
| `PATCH /api/messages/{id}` | `message.updated` | `message` |
| `DELETE /api/messages/{id}` (first time) | `message.deleted` | `message_id` |
| add a reaction (new) | `reaction.added` | `message_id`, `emoji`, `user_id` |
| remove a reaction (existing) | `reaction.removed` | `message_id`, `emoji`, `user_id` |
| a user is added to the channel (join, creator, `#general` auto-join) | `member.joined` | `user_id` |
| a member leaves | `member.left` | `user_id` |
| `PATCH /api/channels/{id}` | `channel.updated` | `channel` (ChannelObj) |
| archive (was active) | `channel.archived` | `channel` |
| unarchive (was archived) | `channel.unarchived` | `channel` |

B4.5 **No-ops emit nothing.** A repeated reaction, a join by an existing member, a leave by a
non-member, a second delete, archiving an archived channel and unarchiving an active one commit
no event, so the next real event is exactly +1.

B4.6 **Resume.** On any node, `{"type": "resume", "channel_id": <id>, "since_event_id": <n>}` makes
the server send every event with `event_id > n` in order, then
`{"type": "resumed", "channel_id": <id>, "head_event_id": <last event_id sent, or n>}`, and then
keep delivering new events live, as after `subscribe`. Resuming from the current head sends only
`resumed`. Keep every event; if `since_event_id` is ever older than the oldest kept event minus 1,
send `{"type": "resume.gap", "channel_id": <id>, "earliest_event_id": <int>}` first and replay
from there.

B4.7 **Redis outage.** With `redis-server` killed, a post on `8001` still reaches a subscriber on
`8000` within 5 seconds with the next `event_id`, and `start.sh` has Redis listening again within
10 seconds.

B4.8 **Concurrent writes.** 60 posts sent at the same time (six parallel senders, two per node)
all return `201`, and a subscriber receives exactly 60 `message.created` frames whose `event_id`s
run from head + 1 to head + 60 with no gaps, duplicates or reordering. Allocate the `event_id`
inside the write transaction (architecture rule 3), never as `MAX(...) + 1` outside it.

B4.9 **Replay after a node dies.** With the process on `8001` killed, posts through `8000` and
`8002` still return `201`. A new WebSocket on `8002` that resumes from the head it saw before the
kill gets exactly those events, then `resumed`. Once `8001` is back (within 15 seconds), a post
through `8001` reaches that socket live with the next `event_id`.

Every request must answer within 5 seconds.
