# A.4: Invitations and join mode

Rule group: **A4**.
Check: `python3 /spec/roles/checks/check_roles_4.py`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Do not start this step until `check_roles_3.py` prints `RESULT: 11 passed, 0 failed`.

## Uses

Call these from A.1 to A.3. Do not write a second version of any of them.

| Function | Used here for |
|---|---|
| `get_workspace(slug)`, `member_role(workspace_id, user_id)` | The owner/admin checks |
| `add_workspace_member(c, workspace_id, user_id, "member")` | Accepting an invitation (also joins `#general`) |
| `join_channel(user, channel_id)` | Add the `invite_only` rule (A4.10) here |
| `workspace_to_json(row)`, `now_iso()`, `tx()` | Responses, timestamps, transactions |

## Adds

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `create_invitation(actor, slug, body)` | Rule A4.1, A4.6 (validation, targeted invites) |
| `invitation_to_json(row)` | `{code, workspace_id, invited_user_id, max_uses, uses, expires_at, created_at}` |
| `accept_invitation(user, code)` | Rules A4.4 to A4.8 |
| `revoke_invitation(actor, slug, code)` | Rule A4.8 |
| `update_workspace(actor, slug, body)` | Rule A4.9 |

An invitation is **active** when it is not revoked, `uses < max_uses`, and it has not expired.

## Rules

### A4. Invitations and join mode

A4.1 **Create.** `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/invitations` by an owner or admin, with body
`{expires_in_seconds?, max_uses?, invited_username?, invited_user_id?}`, returns `201` and
`{invitation}` holding a non-empty URL-safe `code`. `max_uses` defaults to `1`. A non-positive or
non-integer `expires_in_seconds` or `max_uses` returns `400`; an `invited_username` or
`invited_user_id` that matches no user returns `404`.

A4.2 **Members cannot manage invitations.** A `member` or `guest` gets `403` creating, listing or
revoking invitations.

A4.3 **List.** `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}/invitations` by an owner or admin returns `200` and
`{invitations: [...]}` with every *active* invitation of the workspace. Admins may create them
too (`201`).

A4.4 **Accept.** `POST /api/invitations/{code}/accept` returns `200` and `{workspace}`, consumes
one use, and adds the caller as a workspace `member` (which also joins `#general`). A caller who
is already a member gets `200` without consuming a use. Once all uses are consumed the code returns
`404` on accept and is no longer listed.

A4.5 **Several uses.** With `max_uses: 2`, exactly two different users get `200`; the third gets
`404`.

A4.6 **Targeted invitations.** With `invited_user_id` or `invited_username`, the invitation is
single-use: the response shows `max_uses: 1` whatever the body said. Any other user accepting it
gets `403` (no use consumed); the target gets `200`.

A4.7 **Expiry.** An invitation created with `expires_in_seconds: 1` returns `404` on accept once
that second has passed, and is no longer listed.

A4.8 **Revoke.** `DELETE /api/workspaces/{slug}/invitations/{code}` by an owner or admin returns
`200` and `{"deleted": true}`; an unknown code returns `404`. A revoked code returns `404` on accept
and is not listed. Accepting a code that never existed returns `404`.

A4.9 **Workspace settings.** `PATCH /api/workspaces/{slug}` with any subset of `{name, join_mode}`
by an owner or admin returns `200` and `{workspace}` with the change applied. A `join_mode` other
than `"open"` or `"invite_only"`, or an empty name, returns `400`. A `member` gets `403`.

A4.10 **Invite-only.** When `join_mode` is `"invite_only"`, a user who is not a workspace member
gets `403` on `POST /api/channels/{id}/join` for a public channel and is not added. After accepting
an invitation, the same join returns `200`.

A4.11 **Bad input is a 400, never a 500.** Every Spec A route checks the JSON type of each field it
reads before using it. A wrong type (for example a number for `username`, `slug`, `name` or
`role`, a string for `max_uses`, `expires_in_seconds` or `new_owner_id`, `null` for `join_mode`)
returns `400`, and so does a body that is not valid JSON. Login with non-string fields returns
`400` or `401`. No route answers `500` to bad input.

Every request must answer within 5 seconds.
