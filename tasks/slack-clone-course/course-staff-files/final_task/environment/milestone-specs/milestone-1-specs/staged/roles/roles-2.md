# A.2: Workspaces and joining

Rule group: **A2**.
Check: `python3 /spec/roles/checks/check_roles_2.py`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Do not start this step until `check_roles_1.py` prints `RESULT: 17 passed, 0 failed`.

## Uses

Call these from A.1. Do not write a second version of any of them.

| Function | Used here for |
|---|---|
| `tx()`, `now_iso()` | Every insert below runs in one transaction |
| `require_user(request)` | `401` on every route in this step |
| `user_to_json(row)` | The `user` inside each `members` entry |
| `json_error(status, msg)` | `400`, `403`, `404`, `409` responses |

## Adds

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `workspace_to_json(row)` | `{id, slug, name, owner_id, join_mode}` |
| `get_workspace(slug)` | The workspace row, or `404` |
| `member_role(workspace_id, user_id)` | `"owner"`, `"admin"`, `"member"`, `"guest"`, or `None` |
| `add_workspace_member(c, workspace_id, user_id, role)` | Inserts the membership if missing, then calls `add_channel_member` for `#general` |
| `create_channel_row(c, workspace_id, name, is_private, topic, creator_id)` | Inserts a channel; the creator (if any) joins it |
| `channel_to_json(row)`, `get_channel(channel_id)` | `ChannelObj` (see B1.1); lookup or `404` |
| `add_channel_member(c, channel_id, user_id)` | Inserts if missing; returns True only when a row was added |
| `join_channel(user, channel_id)` | Every join rule in A2.7 to A2.9 (A3.8 and A4.10 extend it) |

## Rules

### A2. Workspaces and joining

A2.1 **Create a workspace.** `POST /api/workspaces` with `{slug, name}` returns `201` and
`{workspace, general_channel}`. `workspace` is `{id, slug, name, owner_id, join_mode}` with
`owner_id` = the caller's id and `join_mode` = `"open"`. `general_channel` is a `ChannelObj` named
`"general"` with `is_private: false` and `workspace_id` = `workspace.id`. The caller becomes a
workspace member with role `owner` and a member of `#general`.

A2.2 **Duplicate slug.** A slug that is already taken returns `409`, whoever sends it.

A2.3 **Validation.** `slug` must match `^[a-z0-9-]{2,32}$`: `"Bad-Slug"`, `"a"`, a 33-character
slug, `"has space"` and `"under_score"` each return `400`. `name` must be a non-empty string; a
missing name returns `400`.

A2.4 **List workspaces.** `GET /api/workspaces` returns `200` and `{workspaces: [WorkspaceObj,
...]}` containing only workspaces where the caller is a member (any role, owner included).

A2.5 **List members.** `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}/members` returns `200` and
`{members: [{user_id, role, user}, ...]}`: one entry per workspace member, where `user` is a
`UserObj`. The creator has role `owner`. A caller who is not a member gets `403`; an unknown slug
gets `404`.

A2.6 **Create a channel.** `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/channels` with `{name, is_private?}` by the
owner returns `201` and `{channel}`. `is_private` defaults to `false`. The creator becomes a member
of the channel. (Name and topic validation are rules B1.1 to B1.3; role limits are A3.8 and A3.9.)

A2.7 **Open join.** In a workspace whose `join_mode` is `"open"`, `POST /api/channels/{id}/join` on
a *public* channel by a user who is not a workspace member returns `200` and `{channel}`. The
caller becomes a workspace member with role `member` (which also adds them to `#general`), joins
the channel, and now sees the workspace in `GET /api/workspaces`.

A2.8 **Join is idempotent.** Joining a channel you are already in returns `200` and changes
nothing: no duplicate member entry, same role.

A2.9 **Join errors.** An unknown channel id returns `404`. A private channel returns `403` for
anyone who is not already a member of it (there is no channel-invite flow in this run); an
existing member gets `200`.

Every request must answer within 5 seconds.
