# A.3: Workspace roles

Rule group: **A3**.
Check: `python3 /spec/roles/checks/check_roles_3.py`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Do not start this step until `check_roles_2.py` prints `RESULT: 9 passed, 0 failed`.

## Uses

Call these from A.1 and A.2. Do not write a second version of any of them.

| Function | Used here for |
|---|---|
| `get_workspace(slug)`, `member_role(workspace_id, user_id)` | Finding the caller's and the target's role |
| `workspace_to_json(row)` | The response of `transfer_ownership` |
| `join_channel(user, channel_id)` | Add the guest rule (A3.8) here, not in a new function |
| `create_channel_row(...)` | Channel creation, now behind the role check in A3.8 and A3.9 |
| `tx()` | Role updates and the ownership swap, each in one transaction |

## Adds

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `set_member_role(actor, slug, target_user_id, body)` | Rules A3.1 to A3.7, in the check order given in A3.6 |
| `transfer_ownership(actor, slug, body)` | Rules A3.10 and A3.11 |

## Rules

### A3. Roles

Roles are per workspace: `owner`, `admin`, `member`, `guest`. Exactly one member is the owner.

A3.1 **Promote.** `PATCH /api/workspaces/{slug}/members/{user_id}` with `{role}` returns `200` and
`{member: {user_id, role}}`. The owner may set `admin`, `member` or `guest` on any member who is
not the owner. `GET /api/workspaces/{slug}/members` then shows the new role.

A3.2 **Admins manage non-admins.** An admin may set `member`, `guest` or `admin` on a member or a
guest.

A3.3 **Admins cannot touch admins or the owner.** An admin targeting another admin, or the owner,
gets `403` and nothing changes.

A3.4 **Bad role.** `role: "owner"` returns `400` (ownership moves only through
`transfer_ownership`). A role that is not `admin`, `member` or `guest`, or a missing role, also
returns `400`.

A3.5 **The owner's role is fixed.** Any PATCH whose target is the current owner returns `403`,
including the owner targeting themself.

A3.6 **Only owners and admins.** A caller whose role is `member` or `guest` (or who is not in the
workspace) gets `403`. Check order: `401` → unknown slug `404` → caller not owner/admin `403` →
bad role `400` → target not a member `404` → target is the owner, or an admin targeting another
admin `403`.

A3.7 **Unknown target.** A `user_id` that is not a member of the workspace returns `404`.

A3.8 **Guests are limited.** A `guest` gets `403` on `POST /api/channels/{id}/join` for a public
channel, and `403` on `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/channels`.

A3.9 **Who creates which channel.** A `member` creating a public channel gets `201`; a `member`
sending `{is_private: true}` gets `403`. An `admin` or the `owner` may create private channels
(`201`).

A3.10 **Transfer errors.** `POST /api/workspaces/{slug}/transfer_ownership` with `{new_owner_id}`
from anyone but the owner (admins included) returns `403`. If the target is not currently an
`admin` (a member, a guest, a non-member, or the owner themself) it returns `400` and nothing
changes.

A3.11 **Transfer.** When the owner transfers to an admin, the response is `200` and
`{workspace}`. The target's role becomes `owner`, `workspace.owner_id` becomes the target's id
(also in `GET /api/workspaces`), and the previous owner's role becomes `admin`. The previous owner
now gets `403` on `transfer_ownership`.
