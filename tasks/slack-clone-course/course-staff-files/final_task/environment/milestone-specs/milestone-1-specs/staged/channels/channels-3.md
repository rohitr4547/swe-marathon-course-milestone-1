# B.3: Pins and search

Rule group: **B3**.
Check: `python3 /spec/channels/checks/check_channels_3.py`. The rule numbers below match its output.

Do not start this step until `check_channels_2.py` prints `RESULT: 14 passed, 0 failed`.

## Uses

Call these from earlier steps. Do not write a second version of any of them.

| Function | Used here for |
|---|---|
| `parse_paging(query, kind)`, `encode_cursor(...)`, `decode_cursor(...)` | Pins (`"pin"`) and search (`"srch"`) paging |
| `message_to_json(row)` | Pin entries and search results |
| `get_channel(id)`, `can_read_channel(user_id, channel)` | `404` and `403` |
| `now_iso()`, `tx()` | `pinned_at`, transactions |

## Adds

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pin(user, message_id)`, `unpin(user, message_id)` | B3.1, B3.3 |
| `list_pins(user, channel_id, query)` | B3.2, B3.4; pages on a pin sequence number, newest first |
| `search(user, query)` | B3.5 to B3.7 |

## Rules

### B3. Pins and search

B3.1 **Pin.** `POST /api/messages/{id}/pin` returns `200` and
`{pin: {message_id, pinned_by, pinned_at}}` (`pinned_at` UTC, ending in `Z`). Pinning an already
pinned message returns `200` and the original pin unchanged (same `pinned_by` and `pinned_at`).
The caller must pass the access rule.

B3.2 **Pin list.** `GET /api/channels/{id}/pins?limit=&cursor=` returns `200` and
`{pins: [{message, pinned_by, pinned_at}, ...], next_cursor}` with `message` a `MessageObj`, most
recently pinned first. Same limit and cursor rules as B2.7 to B2.10 (a bad cursor returns `400`).

B3.3 **Unpin.** `DELETE /api/messages/{id}/pin` returns `200` and `{"unpinned": true}` (also when
the message was not pinned), and the message leaves the pin list.

B3.4 **Private pins.** A user who is not a member of a private channel gets `403` on its pin list.

B3.5 **Search.** `GET /api/search?q=<text>&limit=&cursor=` returns `200` and
`{results: [MessageObj, ...], next_cursor}`: non-deleted messages (top-level and replies) whose
body contains `q`, case-insensitively, newest first, only from channels the caller can read under
the access rule. A user with access to nothing gets `results: []`.

B3.6 **Workspace filter.** `workspace_id=<id>` limits the results to that workspace.

B3.7 **Search paging and validation.** Search pages with the same limit and cursor rules as B2.
A missing or empty `q` returns `400`; `limit=0` returns `400`.

Every request must answer within 5 seconds.
